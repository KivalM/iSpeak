Hello! You said "hello" almost perfectly! Here's how you can say it even better:

1. Start with an "h" sound, like when you're breathing out.
2. Then, make a short "e" sound, like in "bed", but very quick.
3. Next, say "l", like the start of "lamb".
4. Finally, end with "oh", like in "open", but again, make it quick.

So, it should sound like: "h" - "e" - "l" - "oh". You're doing great! Keep practicing, and you'll be saying "hello" like a pro in no time! 😊👍
